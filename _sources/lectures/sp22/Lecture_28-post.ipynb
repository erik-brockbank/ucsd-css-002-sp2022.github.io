Try making a script to scrape product information from Amazon or flight information from United and you'll quickly find your requests failing...\n",
    "- Third, many web pages have developed sophisticated **APIs** for fetching information from them. On the one hand, this gives you a much more structured and reliable response than merely web scraping. On the other hand, it also gives the web pages themselves much more control over what information you can request. \n",
