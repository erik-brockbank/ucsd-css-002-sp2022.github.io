    "1. They represent the axes on which our data has the highest variance (the first principal component is the highest, the second is the second highest, ...)\n",
    "2. They are *orthogonal* to each other, meaning they are *independent* as predictors of our data\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these properties, when we *project* our data onto the principal components, we can often describe most of the variance in our high-dimensional data with only a few principal component axes. In other words, they provide a high fidelity *summary* of what our data is doing without needing all the original dimensions. \n",
