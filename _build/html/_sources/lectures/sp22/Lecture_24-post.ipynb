Another tutorial [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/gaussian-mixture-models-explained-6986aaf5a95) illustrates the math in fine detail if you want to understand this on a more technical level. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of estimating this model follows two steps, very similar to $k$-means clustering!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like $k$-means, we start by *initializing our clusters*. With $k$-means all we needed was to guess our cluster centers. Now, we need initial estimates for all the parameters above: $\\mu$, $\\Sigma$, and $w$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $w$: For our weights, we can assume to start that each cluster has an equal number of data points: $w_j = 1/k$\n",
    "- $\\mu$: in theory, we can initialize our $\\mu$ values to be randomly sampled points like we did with $k$-means. However, the more popular approach here is to actually run $k$-means and use the centers that it estimates!\n",
    "- $\\Sigma$: our covariance matrix can be initialized to something generic (identity matrix, 1s, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the first step of the algorithm is to figure out the *probability that each data point was sampled from each of the potential clusters* with the cluster parameters initialized above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, we make a table like the one below for each point in $X$. This table assumes that $X$ is 2-dimensional as in our mouse example above, and assumes there are 3 clusters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| $x$ | $p(j=1)$ | $p(j=2)$ | $p(j=3)$ | \n",

    "| (2, 5) |  |  | | |\n",
    "| ... |  |  | | |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With multi-variate Gaussians, the probability that a point was sampled from a particular distribution is pretty straightforward: we can use the probability density function for the Gaussian with the current parameter estimates $\\mu_j$ and $\\Sigma_j$.\n",
    "- Here, we also scale the probabilities by the weights for each cluster and divide by the probabilities assigned to the other clusters for each point. \n",
    "- So each row in the table above would have $x_1$ and $x_2$ values for a given point, plus three probabilities that sum to 1 indicating the probability of that point belonging to each cluster $j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For cluster 1, we would set the probability that $x_i$ is in cluster 1 to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x_i = \\text{cluster 1} | \\ \\theta) = \\dfrac{w_1 \\ \\mathcal{N}(x_i | \\mu_1, \\Sigma_1)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{k} w_j \\ \\mathcal{N}(x_i | \\mu_j, \\Sigma_j)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note this step echoes the *assignment* step of $k$-means, except we're calculating a *probability* for each point belonging in each cluster instead of simply assigning each point to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we figure out the *best parameter estimates* for each cluster **based on the probabilities assigned to each data point in Step 1**. This echoes the step in $k$-means where we re-evaluated each cluster center. However, now things are more complicated because we need to revise all the cluster parameters above.\n",
    "- $w_j$: We start by adding up the probability of each point belonging to cluster $j$ from Step 1. This tells us how many points we *expect* to have in that cluster. Then, we set each weight $w_j$ to just be the number of points estimated for that cluster divided by the total number of data points $N$. For example, our weight for cluster 1, $w_1$, would be set to:\n",
    "$$w_1 := \\dfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(j=1)_i}{N}$$\n",
    "- $\\mu_j$: Our $\\mu_j$, the estimated mean of each cluster, will be the average of all our data points weighted by the probability of each value belonging to cluster $j$. For example:\n",
    "$$\\mu_1 := \\dfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_n \\ p(j=1)_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(j=1)_i}$$\n",
    "- $\\Sigma_j$: Our $\\Sigma_j$, similar to the above, will be the covariance of all our datapoints $(x_1, x_2)$, weighted by the probability of each point belonging to our cluster $j$. If you're familiar with the notation for expressing covariance below, it looks like this:\n",
    "$$\\Sigma_1 := \\dfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(j=1)_i \\ (x_i - \\mu_1)(x_i - \\mu_1)^T}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(j=1)_i}$$\n",

    "The formal steps for these parameter updates isn't super important (but is helpful if this is familiar notation!). The key take-away is the *operation* being done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3** \n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat Step 1 and Step 2 until convergence. Convergence occurs when we've more or less maximized our *log likelihood*, the $log \\ p(X | \\theta)$ using the equation for $p(X | \\theta)$ above.\n",
