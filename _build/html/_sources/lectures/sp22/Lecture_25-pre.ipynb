    "\n",
    "Broadly, the goal of dimensionality reduction is, as the name implies, to **take data that exists in a very high dimensional space and find a way to represent the points in that space as accurately as possible with as few dimensions as possible**.\n",

    "- High dimensional data can make it more difficult to fit models\n",
    "    - Aside: the \"curse of dimensionality\": in machine learning settings, adding dimensions to your data will initially improve your models, but eventually, your data becomes *sparse* in very high dimensions, meaning it no longer clusters in useful ways. This will make your models **worse** or require much much more data to fit. Read about this on wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) or on Medium [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-curse-of-dimensionality-50dc6e49aa1e).\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, dimensionality reduction techniques make it easier for us to visualize, reason about, and fit models to our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, dimensionality reduction is often used alongside other analysis techniques we've discussed in this class: before performing classification or clustering on your data, it may be helpful to first reduce it to a lower dimensional space and *then* classify based on the lower dimensional feature representation or cluster in the lower dimension."

    "## Solution: Principal Components Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is it**\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis is based on a fairly simple but really powerful intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    ">If we plot a line through our data that minimizes how far our data points are from the line and maximizes the spread of our data points *along* the line, then we can do a pretty good job describing our data in just one dimension with that line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the graph below to see how we might find this sort of line through our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![pca](img/pca.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "This image comes from a brief tutorial about PCA [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues) (the writing is sexist but the explanation of PCA itself is pretty good). In the image, the blue points are our original data, and the red points are our data points mapped onto the line for different possible lines through our data. The red lines show the \"error\" in this mapping. What this is showing is that when the line through our data points is aligned with the purple edges, the *projection* of our data points onto that line (in red) has the lowest error and the highest variance, which is what we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The line through the purple edges does a good job describing the overall trend in our data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we can find a *second line* perpendicular to the first, we can capture *additional variance in our data* with the second line that isn't captured by the first line. PCA is often illustrated with a series of lines like this. These are called the **principal components**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![pca_static](img/pca_static.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This image comes from a really awesome tutorial [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-pca-fae3e243731d). I highly recommend reading it :)\n",
    "\n",
    "What defines the principal components is that they are lines that a) are perpendicular to each other, and b) capture the maximal amount of variance in our data. The *first component* captures the most variance, the second component captures the second most, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the principal components**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Isn't this a lot like regression??* Yes! Just like a regression line can be specified in terms of coefficients $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, ..., $\\beta_n$ applied to our predictor variables $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$, the principal components are described as a series of *weights* on each predictor variable. These weights map our data points ($x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$) onto the principal component line in the same way that regression coefficients map our data points onto the regression line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**However, there's one key difference** between regression and PCA. Our best fitting regression line was the one that *minimized sum of squared error in $y$*. Remember what that looked like? As you can see in the animation above, PCA is doing something slightly different; it's minimizing each data point's Euclidean distance to the line, rather than its distance in $y$ alone. This is an important difference and it means the two techniques aren't guaranteed to draw the same line. What we wanted with regression was the best way to predict $y$. What we want with PCA is the best way to predict our data across all dimensions.\n",

    "**How to calculate the principal components**\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we estimate these super handy *principal component* lines? It turns out there's a super handy *analytic* solution based on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of our data (briefly: the principal components are the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues). We're not going to get into how that actually works here, but it's important that you know where they come from (we aren't *estimating* them but calculating them). If you want to read more about it, take a look at [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c) tutorial or [this](https://georgemdallas.wordpress.com/2013/10/30/principal-component-analysis-4-dummies-eigenvectors-eigenvalues-and-dimension-reduction/) one, or the derivation on the wikipedia page for PCA [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis#Details).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensionality reduction with the principal components**\n",
    "\n",
    "To tie this all together, once we've calculated our principal components, we can represent our data in fewer dimensions *by mapping each data point onto a small number of principal components*. In other words, we change each data point from being written as ($x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$) to something like ($pc_1$, $pc_2$, $pc_3$), where $pc_1$ is our data point's value when projected onto the first principal component line. Instead of the *axes* of our data being $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., we now represent our data on *new* axes $pc_1$, $pc_2$, ... that allow us to describe the pattern in our data more efficiently. "
