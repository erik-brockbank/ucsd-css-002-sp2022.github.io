Try making a script to scrape product information from Amazon or flight information from United and you'll quickly find your requests failing...\n",
    "- Third, many web pages have developed sophisticated **APIs** for fetching information from them. On the one hand, this gives you a much more structured and reliable response than merely web scraping. On the other hand, it also gives the web pages themselves much more control over what information you can request. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. For almost all publicly facing APIs like the ones above, your first step is to create a \"developer account\" so the API can track the requests you're making.\n",
    "2. Next, you create an \"app\" on your developer account. When you do this, the API will give you a set of \"keys\" or \"tokens\" that you can use to make requests against the API. This is confusing the first time around, but becomes a lot of copy-paste once you've done it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most APIs, you can view your apps and copy or regenerate keys on a page like this one:\n",
