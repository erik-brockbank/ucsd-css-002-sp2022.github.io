    "\n",

    "### Supervised movie genres\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, music or movie stores are roughly organized by *genre*. One of the ways people find new books or movies they expect to enjoy is by perusing the shelves for genres they like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying music or movie genres is a kind of **supervised classification problem**. Given a large set of features like who is in a movie, who made it, even the plot summary, and a set of labeled examples, we can learn to map these features onto genre predictions. Then, when a new movie arrives on our shelves, we can predict its genre based on its features. Or, when a customer asks for a movie recommendation, we can show them movies in their favorite genres. \n",
    "\n",
    "![blockbuster](img/blockbuster.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised movie genres\n",
    "\n",
    "But, when you go to a streaming site like Netflix, or when Spotify tells you your \"top genres\", this isn't usually how they recommend new titles or music. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, they assume that there is deep structure in the ways people watch movies or the music they listen to which may not always correspond to particular *genres* but *is* helpful for organizing their movie library and identifying what people want to see or hear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Their recommendation systems use **unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction** to determine what kind of movies or music people will enjoy (note: I haven't seen how Netflix or Spotify solve these problems but this is a fairly safe assumption). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Netflix may look for ways of *clustering* their movies based on the movies people tended to watch together, then try to come up with descriptive genres after the fact (\"Heart-warming family movies\" or \"Animated comedies\"). Spotify does similar things when it describes the genres you listen to. \n",
    "\n",
    "![netflix](img/netflix_genres.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is something you encounter all the time in today's tech ecosystem. Other recommendation systems (e.g., Amazon suggesting future purchases) rely on it, as do many other algorithms that have a) rich data and b) complex behaviors or outputs that may be hard to categorize."

    "The `inertia_` attribute for the `KMeans` class gives us this, as does the `score` function (this gives us negative inertia technically). \n",

    "One way to choose the number of clusters is to find the point where our *inertia* isn't getting any lower even as we add more clusters."
