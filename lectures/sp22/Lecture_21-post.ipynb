    "How can we think about a more general framework for ethics in modeling? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is beyond the scope of this lecture (and my knowledge!), but here are some guideposts:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data considerations (inputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the issues outlined above center on *data*, the model's *inputs*.\n",
    "- Models used in business and public sector work often require large amounts of data to train and validate.\n",
    "- This raises ethical concerns about the data's *source* and its *representativeness*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things you should think about when modeling large datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Where does your data *come from*?\n",
    "- Collecting and distributing this data can introduce concerns around privacy and consent\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is your data *representative*?\n",
    "- If your data has significant biases or doesn't represent certain populations, your model risks making predictions, classifications, or recommendations that reflect these same biases or omissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model behavior considerations (outputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of the ethical considerations that arise with modeling and AI are centered on data. In some cases, the model's *behavior itself* may be deemed unethical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things worth considering when it comes to the model's *output*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Could this model be a problem in the hands of *bad actors*?\n",
    "- Models that are initially constructed for one purpose can be misused. What are the potential consequences?\n",
    "- Note: potential bad consequences don't mean we *shouldn't* use the model, but it's an important discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Could this model engage in behavior that would be considered unethical or harmful through its normal operations?\n",
    "- Models that are used in high stakes settings (e.g., driving) may make decisions that can harm others. What kinds of harm or undesired behavior can we anticipate when leveraging a model?\n",
    "- Note: once again, the potential for harm may not be in and of itself a reason to avoid the model (self-driving cars are likely to get in accidents) but once again, this is an important discussion to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues of ethical AI and modeling are at the forefront of many public policy debates. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in this, take a look at discussions of \"transparent\" or \"explainable\" AI ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence)), or other specific initiatives aimed at providing oversight into how AI gets used in various setting (e.g. [this](https://pretrialrisk.com/) group for monitoring use of risk assessment tools in criminal settings).\n"
