    "**Every model makes certain assumptions about the *generative process* for the data it's trying to capture.** \n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions or constraints are, in part, what allow the model to make sense of the world; they *simplify* our description of what's going on. \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"All models are wrong, but some are useful\" ~ George Box (a statistician)\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already seen this in a previous problem set: simple linear regression assumes that the relationship between two variables will produce *normally distributed residuals* around the line that gets fit. Multiple regression assumes that the predictors aren't correlated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes these assumptions aren't stated explicitly but the mechanics of the model require them. With $k$-means clustering, the model will converge to centroids that (roughly) minimize each point's distance to the nearest centroid. **This process therefore assumes that all of the clusters are the same size.**\n",

    "- If you think that the *real world process that generated your data* aligns with the model's assumptions, or that  this is a useful simplification to your real world data, then it's probably okay. \n",
    "    - For example, your residuals in a linear regression may never be perfectly normally distributed.\n",
    "- On the other hand, if you think the process that generated your data is more fundamentally at odds with the model's assumptions, then you probably need a different model. \n",
    "    - The data above is a good example of a scenario where $k$-means is probably the wrong model because our clusters have *very* different variances and we want our cluster solutions to reflect that.\n",

    "*So what do we use instead?*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a **lot** of different clustering solutions out there; like classification, we could probably have a whole quarter devoted just to clustering. \n",
    "- The sklearn package has classes for many of the most common ones. You can see the full list [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.cluster)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not going to go through the other solutions out there (there are many, and they're each complex in their own way so we would need a lot more time to cover them. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, on Friday we're going to talk about one other solution that is important to be familiar with: **Gaussian mixture models**.\n",
