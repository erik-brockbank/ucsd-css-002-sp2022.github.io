    "# Cross-validation: avoiding overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different techniques for *cross-validation*, one of which we discussed on Friday. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, at their heart, all of them involve the same underlying principle: *estimate your model parameters with only a subset (or repeated subsets) of your data, then evaluate your model on the remaining data to ensure generalizability*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This technique allows you to ensure that your model is a good fit, or do *model comparison* to choose among different candidate models (such as our polynomial models above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than go through all of the different ways of doing this, I'll walk through a few of the more well known ones. This will give you a feel for how cross-validation works. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Holdout* cross-validation**: this is the technique we reviewed on Friday\n",
    "    - Split data into *training* and *test* data (e.g. 75-25 split)\n",
    "    - Train model on *training data only*\n",
    "    - Evaluate model on *test data*\n",
    "2. ***k-fold* cross-validation**: This is a more robust version of holdout cross-validation\n",
    "    - Split data into *k* equal sized buckets (randomly!)\n",
    "    - Choose one of the buckets to be *test* data and assign the rest to be *training* data\n",
    "    - Perform holdout cross-validation with this data\n",
    "    - Then, repeat the above *for each of the other buckets* and average your test results (e.g., MSE) over the multiple runs\n",
    "3. ***Monte-carlo* cross-validation** (repeated random subsampling): Similar to k-fold, but *random*\n",
    "    - Split the data into training and test data randomly\n",
    "    - Evaluate model on test data\n",
    "    - Repeat this process many times\n",
    "4. **Exhaustive cross-validation** (various methods): The most common of these are *leave-one-out* or *leave-p-out* cross-validation\n",
    "    - For every individual value in the data or set of $p$ values, train the model on all remaining data then evalute the model using this individual or set of $p$ values\n",
    "    - Note: this is *exhaustive* because every data point or set of $p$ data points is used in the test set, but is often computationally intractable!\n",
    "5. **Other** methods: specific to particular types of data (e.g., time series data, classification data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on this, you can check out [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-8-types-of-cross-validation-80c935a4976d) blog, or the wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) devoted to this topic, or many others like it online!"
